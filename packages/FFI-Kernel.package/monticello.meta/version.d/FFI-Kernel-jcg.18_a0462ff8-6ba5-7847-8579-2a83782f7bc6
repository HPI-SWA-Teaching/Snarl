(name 'FFI-Kernel-jcg.18'message 'Improvement to ExternalForm>>setManualSurfacePointer:.  The pointer is now internally stored as an ExternalStructure instead of a raw ExternalAddress.  It is no longer allowed to pass an integer argument to #setManualSurfacePointer:.  This could conceivably break some code, but ExternalForm is so new (and infrequently used, AFAICT) that it doesn''t make sense to commit to backward-compatibility for an ill-considered API decision.'id 'a0462ff8-6ba5-7847-8579-2a83782f7bc6'date '6 June 2010'time '1:40:40.13 pm'author 'jcg'ancestors ((id 'c77faebf-fc41-bc4c-bc41-2497a3edc97e'))stepChildren ())
