(name 'CommandShell-Base-dtl.24'message 'CommandShell 4.5.5Address process synchronization issues exposed by unit tests.An error pipeline stream is shared by multiple process proxies, so do not raise an error in PipeJunction>>closeErrorPipeline if the close fails.Add a short (10 ms) delay ProxyPipeline>>value after each proxy is started in order to permit associated (Smalltalk) processes to be scheduled to service that proxy. When using AIO event driven streams, this permits a BufferedAsyncFileReadStream to start its event handler process.'id 'b2038c80-86e2-49fe-bd5a-e985567e84aa'date '29 August 2012'time '6:30:17.795 pm'author 'dtl'ancestors ((id '1b62537d-fe7d-422d-86b7-7dc4bb0dc04e'))stepChildren ())
