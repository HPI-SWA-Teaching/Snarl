(name 'CommandShell-Base-dtl.19'message 'CommandShell 4.5.0Update RemoteTask to support asynchronous task completion notification. Eliminate redundant buffering of input stream, and read the result object directly from the pipe reader upon notification of data available from the remote image. Processing no longer waits for remote image exit, and does not read remote data into intermediate buffers and streams.Add #do:whenComplete: to schedule a remote task (image forked in separate OS process) with results handled in a completion block. The supervisory Squeak image carries none of the processing load during remote task execution.Support forkSqueak with AIO event handling to provide notification of data available from remote Squeak.'id 'fc647d20-ea82-4cb1-9c6c-6f15edd35664'date '13 November 2011'time '1:15:27.166 am'author 'dtl'ancestors ((id '60066c28-bcad-43dc-8fd9-69d1f3d0a649'))stepChildren ())
