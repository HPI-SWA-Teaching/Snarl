DeNigris" <sean@clipperadams.com>To: squeak-dev@lists.squeakfoundation.orgSubject: [squeak-dev] Fix: OSProcess on Windows I made a small fix for MNU #defaultShellPath, which has been reported a few times. I didn''t have repo write access, so I committed tohttp://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~SeanDeNigris/SeansOutbox . Sometimes on Windows (e.g. seemingly when there are quoted command line arguments), the argument to #waitForCommand: and command: must be wrapped in $". I don''t think there is any harm in always doing this (on Windows), but wanted to get feedback from Dave first... OSProcess-Win32-SeanDeNigris.11- Supply shell flags valid for Windows (i.e. ''/c''); shell commands viaPipeableOSProcess are now working, with two restrictions:        - no access to stdout        - argument to #waitXyz: may have to be surroundedByDoubleQuotes OSProcess-Base-SeanDeNigris.41- Extract default shell flags (''-c'') into a method, so that Windows may supply flags valid there (i.e. ''/c'') CommandShell-Piping-SeanDeNigris.15- Fix Win32 shell by providing path to cmd.exe'id '751db28e-7753-4457-bcee-0b3bea2e8f5d'date '29 December 2013'time '1:49:44.84 pm'author 'dtl'ancestors ((id '1784b8ac-ae99-41fa-90b5-12354534dfcb'))stepChildren ())
